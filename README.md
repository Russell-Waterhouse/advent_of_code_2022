The 2022 advent of code, completed in Ruby


## About the Code Quality

If I'm exploring a problem, I'll generally just solve the problem as a spike in a quick and dirty fashion.
After, if the code needs to go production, I'll go back and add proper structure
by refactoring or rewriting it. With Advent of Code, I'm not aiming for production quality code. 

I'm looking to make these initial exploratory spikes quicker and easier. Thus, this repository will contain
some horrendous code, and none of it is what I would do in production.

For example, I was playing around with performance when I did the day 2 challenge and decided to try to do it with ruby 
hash table lookups.
I don't believe this was the best approach, and I didn't believe it at the time, but I wanted to experiment
to see if I could (and I could!).

All of this code is proudly exploratory, horrendous, inefficient, unreadable, downright dirty, and getting me stars.
